I'm an open-minded developer who strives to find creative and innovative solutions to all kinds of problems. From automating simple tasks to making digital tools people can use to improve efficiency. I love helping others wherever I can (if you have a cool project idea or annoying bug I'd be especially eager to help) for the simple reason that collaboration makes the world a better place. 

I'm proficient in Python, C#, C, Java, Bash, JS, and RISC-V assembly. Also competent with C++.
I also have experience with RISC-V Assembly, Blazor framework, React, HTML/CSS (including Bootstrap and Bulma), SQL, Electron.NET framework, and Flask.
I'm a regular Linux user and use Git as my vcs of choice along with JetBrains IDEs for development. 

## ðŸ“° Current Focus
My current project is to build an OS from 0 to 1 :D
